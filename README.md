# Cancer-Death-Rates-in-South-Asia
Time Series Analysis for Cancer Death Rates in South Asia with Python
# 1. Executive Summary
This project shows analysis of cancer death rates across five South Asian countries (2008-2020), which revealed striking divergence in mortality trends. While India and Sri Lanka achieved substantial reductions of 11% and 20.2% respectively, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Thailand experienced increases ranging from 9.5% to 15.5%. Pakistan maintained the highest average death rate at 101.3 per 100,000 population, while Sri Lanka demonstrated the lowest at 70.3 per 100,000. Linear regression analysis effectively captured these trends, with the heatmap visualization clearly illustrating the intensity patterns.
# Problem
Understanding the trends for death rate by Cancer, as it is critical for public health planning, resource allocation, and evaluating the effectiveness of medical interventions. 
# Solution
To employ data-driven analysis to examine historical cancer death rate patterns and develop predictive models. By applying statistical modeling techniques including linear regression and time series analysis to comprehensive cancer mortality datasets, it is possible to identify significant trends, seasonal patterns and factors influencing death rates.
# Impact
The analysis conducted provided various insights like high-risk populations and periods requiring increased intervention. For healtcare systems improving their resource planning based on projected mortality trends, and evidence-based guidance for cancer prevention and treatment programs.
# 2. Methodology
EDA, Trend analysis (linear regression), 
# 3. Skills
Python for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib)
# 4. Results
The box plot distribution analysis revealed that Pakistan had the highest variability in death rates (ranging 95-110), while Sri Lanka maintained the most consistent and lowest rates throughout the period. The heatmap visualization clearly illustrated these patterns through color intensity, with Pakistan and Thailand showing predominantly red (high mortality) zones, while India and Sri Lanka transitioned toward orange and yellow (lower mortality) zones over time. The time series visualizations demonstrated that India's death rate decreased steadily. The findings from the data suggest that healthcare infrastructure improvements, cancer screening programs, and treatment accessibility in India and Sri Lanka have been more effective compared to other South Asian nations, while the increasing trends in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Thailand indicate urgent need for enhanced cancer prevention and treatment interventions
